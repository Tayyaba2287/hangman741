# Hangman
Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.
This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it. You just have to type your guess and the computer will tell you if your guess is in the word. For this game you have 5 attempts. 
## Introduction
As part of my bootcamp at Aicore, I am recreating the hangman game. This is my first project on GitHub. I have learnt a lot of things from doing this project. The most important one being how to document my code and what to write on my README file. I also undertsood how to deal and understand errors in my code. 

## Challenges
One of the challenges that I faced during the project was understanding where to put attributes and certain objects under which function. Through trial and error, I figured out where I should put attributes and other objects. 
Another challenge that I faced was what information to put on docstring. I had to review my lessons and I tried not to put unnecessary information. 

## File structure of the project 
- milestone_2.py to milestone_4.py are python files that was used to code the game step by step and to help in understanding how the game works. If you are interested in knowing the process of how I built the game then you can check out these files.
- milestone_2.py file contains code for the variables of the game. This includes word_list, choosing a random word from the list, asking the user to input their guess.
- milestone_3.py file contains code for to check the guessed letter is in the word. 
- milestone_4.py file contains code for to create the game. This included class and methods of the game.
- milestone_5.py file contains the final code for the hangman game. This is the most important file. If you want to play the game, please run the code on this file.

## Installation Instructions
To install this repository, go on vscode and start a new bash terminal. Make sure you are on the path where you want to download the repository. Copy the link of this repository from Github. Write git clone then insert link, on bash. This should download the repository. 

## How to play the Hangman game
To play the game, go on the milestone_5.py file and run the code. You can run this on GitHub or vscode. Once you run the file python will ask you to guess a letter and it will tell you if you guessed it right, wrong or if you already tried that letter. You have 5 lives, so you keep guessing until you have the right word, or you have 0 lives left. Python will tell you if you have guessed the word.
